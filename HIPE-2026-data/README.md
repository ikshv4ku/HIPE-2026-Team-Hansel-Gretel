# HIPE-2026-data

[HIPE 2026 shared task](https://hipe-eval.github.io/HIPE-2026/) is a [CLEF 2026 Evaluation Lab](https://clef2022.clef-initiative.eu/) on the **extraction and qualification of of person–place relations in multilingual historical documents.**.

Building on the success of [HIPE-2020](https://impresso.github.io/CLEF-HIPE-2020) and [HIPE-2022](https://impresso.github.io/CLEF-HIPE-2022), which focused on entity recognition and linking, HIPE-2026 aims to support answering the question **_Who was where, when?_** and to deepen our understanding of how people and places were connected in historical media. This will enable the reconstruction of life trajectories, the tracing of mobility patterns, and the identification of actors within local contexts.

## HIPE-2026 data

**Contents and preparation**

HIPE-2026 builds on the [HIPE-2022 v2.1](https://github.com/hipe-eval/HIPE-2022-data/tree/main/data/v2.1) NE-annotated historical newspaper datasets.

Primary datasets included in the HIPE-2026 data are those that include PERS and LOC annotations, namely:`impresso-hipe-2020`, `newseye`, `sonar`, and `letemps`.

HIPE-2022 data in IOB format, containing NE mentions and Wikidata QIDs, is converted into JSON, preserving the document text and metadata, and enabling the extraction of person–place pairs.

The preparation process involved roughly the following steps:

1.  Representation transformation: convert IOB-encoded annotations into structured JSON (intermediate JSON schema).
2.  Data cleaning & filtering: merge NIL entities and remove overly long documents.
3.  Extraction of candidate person–location pairs: identify potential pairs within each document and filter.
4.  Annotation — pre-annotate with an ensemble of LLM, then manually review and correct collaboratively.
5.  Final dataset creation: assemble dataset splits and package for release (final JSON schema).

**Format and data representation**

- HIPE-2026 data follows this [JSON schema](https://github.com/hipe-eval/HIPE-2026-data/blob/main/schemas/hipe-2026-data.schema.json).
- All documents from different primary datasets of HIPE-2022 are gathered in the same language-dependent JSON Line file.
- Information on the source document and its metadata are in the `media` property.

**Directory structure and naming convention**

- Training and testing datasets consist of UTF-8 JSON Line files. There is one `.jsonl` file per language and split.
- Files are named according to this schema: `HIPE-2026-vx.x-<dataset>-<train|test>-<lg1>.jsonl`.
- Data directory is organised per HIPE release version and language:

  ```
  data
  └── newspapers
      ├──  v<x.y> # e.g. "1.0"
           ├── HIPE-2026-v<x.y>-newspapers-train-<language>.jsonl # e.g., <language> = "en"
           ├── ...
    └── literaryworks # here will appear the surprise test set
        ├──  v<x.y>
           ├── HIPE-2026-v<x.y>-literaryworks-test-<language>.jsonl
  ```

**Versioning**

- HIPE-2026 releases are versioned `Major.Minor`. Version informatio is present in the data directory structure and data filenames.
- Each HIPE-2026 release has an equivalent git repository release, with release notes.

### Dataset statistics

In [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Av87krWYI1QbQ-_q_UfrVBbKMtcInpJb#scrollTo=sNoDJI242duL) we load the training data and generate some dataset statistics.

### Data validation

To validate that your `.jsonl` files conform to the HIPE-2026 schema:

1. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the validator script directly:

   ```bash
   python scripts/check_jsonlschema.py \
      --schemafile schemas/hipe-2026-data.schema.json \
        data/v1.0/*.jsonl
   ```

Here, `data/v1.0/` can be replaced with a path to the folder that contains your predictions. 


## Prediction and Evaluation Example

Let's pretend this gold file has no labels:

```
data/newspapers/v1.0/HIPE-2026-v1.0-impresso-train-de.jsonl
```

We first predict labels with a random baseline and save the output:

```bash
teamname=RANDOM
python scripts/dummy_predict.py --input_path data/newspapers/v1.0/HIPE-2026-v1.0-impresso-train-de.jsonl \
                                --output_path scripts/tmp/$teamname_HIPE-2026-v1.0-impresso-train-de.jsonl \
```

Then we can evaluate these predictions against the gold file:

```bash
teamname=RANDOM
python scripts/file_scorer_evaluation.py \
--gold_data_file data/newspapers/v1.0/HIPE-2026-v1.0-impresso-train-de.jsonl \
--predictions_file scripts/tmp/$teamname_HIPE-2026-v1.0-impresso-train-de.jsonl
```
